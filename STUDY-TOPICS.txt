DAO Treasury Project - Study Topics and Suggested Schedule

Goal: Prepare to answer evaluation questions about this project (architecture, smart contracts, frontend, deployment, security, testing). Use this guide to study systematically and practice with hands-on tasks.

Estimated total time: 10-12 hours (adjust as needed)

1) Project Overview (30 minutes)
- Read README.md and PROJECT-COMPLETE.md
- Understand purpose: DAO treasury, governance token, proposal lifecycle
- Key components: GovernanceToken, TreasuryDAO, frontend (React + ethers.js), scripts, tests
- Practice: Walk through the file tree and open key files

2) Solidity Fundamentals for this project (60-90 minutes)
- Review Solidity basics: contracts, mappings, events, modifiers
- Specifics used: ERC20 (OpenZeppelin), Ownable, ReentrancyGuard
- Study `GovernanceToken.sol`: ERC20 minting/burning, owner role
- Study `TreasuryDAO.sol`: proposal struct with mappings, depositFunds, createProposal, vote, executeProposal
- Practice: Re-read these contracts and trace storage layout

3) Tokenomics & Minting Logic (30-45 minutes)
- Understand initial supply, owner mint, and the new deposit-mint flow (1 ETH = 1000 GOV)
- Know where `mintByMinter` and `setMinter` are implemented and why authorization is necessary
- Practice: Explain why we authorized TreasuryDAO as a minter in deploy script

4) Frontend Architecture & Web3 Integration (60-90 minutes)
- Study `frontend/src/hooks/useWeb3.js` for wallet connection and network switching
- Study `contractHelpers.js` for contract ABI/address loading and helper methods
- Study `Dashboard.js`, `VotingPanel.js` and `ProposalCard.js` to see data flow (getProposal, hasVoted, vote, createProposal)
- Practice: Trace how the frontend gets treasury balance and shows voting status

5) Deployment & Dev Workflow (45-60 minutes)
- Understand Hardhat scripts: `npm run node`, `npm run deploy:localhost`, `deploy.js`
- Understand how `deploy.js` saves `deployments.json` and ABIs into `frontend/public/contracts` and `frontend/src/contracts`
- Practice: Run the restart-commands sequence locally (start Hardhat node, deploy, start frontend)

6) Testing (45-60 minutes)
- Review tests in `test/` (e.g., `GovernanceToken.test.js`, `TreasuryDAO.test.js`, and `DepositTokenMinting.test.js`)
- Understand test structure: signers, fixtures, assertions
- Practice: Run `npm test` and read failing/passing tests to understand behavior

7) Security & Edge Cases (60 minutes)
- Reentrancy: `ReentrancyGuard` usage for executeProposal
- Access control: `onlyOwner`, `onlyTokenHolder` and minter authorization
- Gas and overflow considerations (Solidity 0.8 handles overflow)
- Edge cases: fractional ETH deposits, re-deployment address changes, front-end ENS resolution
- Practice: Describe how double-voting is prevented and why `hasVoted` mapping is needed

8) Troubleshooting & Common Issues (30-45 minutes)
- Hardhat node restart: contracts get new addresses; re-run deployment, update frontend
- MetaMask network switching (chainId 31337), importing test accounts
- ABI mismatch or stale `deployments.json` – re-run deploy script
- Practice: Simulate a Hardhat restart and re-deploy; note steps to reconnect frontend

9) Demo Walkthrough (60-90 minutes)
- Prepare a short demo script: start node, deploy, start frontend, connect MetaMask, create a proposal, vote, execute
- Practice narrating each step and explaining what happens on-chain

10) Quick Reference Cheat-sheet (15-30 minutes)
- Key contract addresses (after deployment) and functions
- Common commands:
  npm run node
  npm run deploy:localhost
  npm run frontend
  npm test
- Important files to open during evaluation: `TreasuryDAO.sol`, `GovernanceToken.sol`, `deploy.js`, `contractHelpers.js`, `VotingPanel.js`

Study Tips
- Focus on code paths: deposit -> mint -> create proposal -> vote -> execute
- Reproduce actions locally; hands-on is fastest for retention
- Be ready to show contract read-only calls (getTreasuryBalance, getProposal, hasVoted)
- Keep `deployments.json` and ABIs handy for frontend demos

Optional Deep Dives (if you have more time)
- Add off-chain indexing (subgraph / TheGraph) for analytics
- Implement timelock for proposal execution
- Add multisig ownership for extra security
